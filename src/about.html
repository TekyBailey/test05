		<h5 id='expect'><b>What You Can Expect When You Visit</b></h5>
		<p>We know many people are reluctant to visit a church with which they 
					are unfamiliar. For that reason it is our goal to welcome you and 
					make you as comfortable as we can that we may worship our Lord 
					Jesus Christ together. To that goal we want to explain what you 
					can expect in our services when you visit with us. We look 
					forward to your visit!</p>

		<h5><b>Our Goals as a Congregation of God&#39;s People</b></h5>
		<h6>Simply Christians</h6>
		<p class='mgn0-t'>It is our desire to wear no other name than Christ&rsquo;s, and 
					to be known only as Christians (1Peter 4:16) &mdash; members 
					of the body of Christ (Colossians 1:18), which is His church 
					(Ephesians 1:22-23).</p>
		<h6>The Bible is Our Guide</h6>
		<p class='mgn0-t'>We accept the Bible alone as the true and complete revelation 
					of God (1Corinthians 2:11-13, 2Timothy 3:16). We consider the 
					Bible the final authority on all things that pertain to life 
					and godliness (2Peter 1:2-3).</p>
		<h6>Simple Biblical Worship</h6>
		<p class='mgn0-t'>We seek to worship God in truth with all sincerity 
					(John 4:23-26; Joshua 24:14). We try to faithfully follow 
					the pattern of worship set forth in the New Testament for 
					Christians.</p>
		<h6>Prayer</h6>
		<p class='mgn0-t'>We pray together, led by one of the men in the church. We 
					pray to praise God, give Him thanks for all our blessings, 
					to ask His help for ourselves and others in need and to 
					seek God&rsquo;s comfort in our sorrows (1Timothy 2:1-8). 
					We pray from our hearts and mind, trying not to use 
					repetitive ritualized prayers (Matthew 6:5-15).</p>
		<h6>Lord&#39;s Supper</h6>
		<p class='mgn0-t'>The church in the first century met to remember 
					Jesus&rsquo; sacrifice in the Lord&rsquo;s Supper 
					(Acts 20:7). Following that example, we also memorialize 
					our Lord&rsquo;s death , burial and resurrection on each 
					first day of the week in the Lord&rsquo;s Supper. The 
					Lord&rsquo;s Supper consists of unleavened bread and fruit 
					of the vine, as symbols of the body and blood of Christ 
					(1Corinthians 11:20-34).</p>
		<h6>Preaching &amp; Teaching</h6>
		<p class='mgn0-t'>Our Bible studies and sermons are prepared and designed to 
					teach God&rsquo;s Word. Our goal is to learn the Word of 
					God that it might guide us in every aspect of our life and 
					prepare us for every good work for which Christians have 
					been created to do (2Timothy 3:16-17; Ephesians 2:10; 
					Ephesians 4:11-15).</p>
		<h6>Giving as we Prosper</h6>
		<p class='mgn0-t'>We do not take up a collection every time we meet, only 
					on the first day of the week. When the collection baskets 
					are passed through the assembly we do not expect you to give. 
					This is the responsibility of our members, not of our 
					guests (1Corinthians 9:11- 14).</p>

		<h5><b>Our History</b></h5>
		<p>According to the New Testament of Jesus Christ, Jesus added the first 
					members to the church of Christ on the first Pentecost that followed 
					the resurrection of Jesus Christ. (Acts 2) As best we can determine
					the church of Christ came to the Gandy community around 1920's.
					Through the years the church's members have believed in living 
					daily according to the Gospel of Jesus Christ, revealed in the Bible. 
					In the church's public services and in daily life, church members
					preach and teach Jesus Christ. Preaching Christ is to preach God's 
					plan of salvation through His Son Jesus. Preaching Christ is also to 
					preach and edify the church of Christ, Christ's kingdom. Preaching 
					Christ is to speak of His Father who sent Jesus on this mission. 
					Preaching Christ is to promote the Christian life taught by the Holy 
					Spirit and lived every day by true Christians.</p>
